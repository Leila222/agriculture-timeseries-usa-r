# Time Series Data Analysis on Agriculture Production in the USA
This project explores and analyzes agricultural production trends in the United States using time series data and statistical tools in **R**. 
Through data visualization, decomposition, modeling the different components and forecasting models, the goal is to derive insights into the patterns and behaviors of crop and livestock production over time.

## Technologies Used

- **R**
- **ggplot2** – for visualizations  
- **forecast** – for ARIMA and exponential smoothing  
- **tseries** – for statistical testing  
- **dplyr, tidyr** – for data wrangling
  
## Files Included
- `agriculture_production.ipynb`  
  The main R notebook containing data loading, preprocessing, visualization, decomposition, and forecasting steps.
  
- `Agriculture production USA.xlsx`  
  The dataset containing U.S. agricultural production values over time.

- `README.md`  
  Project overview and usage instructions.
